Module 1 Challenge - Case Study on a Company using AI

# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: ModelBest (https://www.linkedin.com/company/modelbest/about/)

* When was the company incorporated? August 2022

* Who are the founders of the company? A team from Tsinghua University

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Idea for the ChatDev Project

* "Motivated by the expert-like potential of autonomous agents, we aim to establish language as a
unifying bridge—utilizing multiple LLM-powered
agents with specialized roles for cooperative software development through language-based communication across different phases; solutions in
different phases are derived from their multi-turn
dialogues, whether dealing with text or code." 	arXiv:2307.07924 [cs.SE] (or arXiv:2307.07924v5 [cs.SE] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.07924

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? $1.48 million dollars (https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/523142-02#faqs)

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

"The frequent occurrence of coding hallucination in turn reflects the constrained autonomy of
agents in task completion, inevitably demanding
additional manual intervention and thereby hindering the immediate usability and reliability of the
generated software (Ji et al., 2023)." 	arXiv:2307.07924 [cs.SE] (or arXiv:2307.07924v5 [cs.SE] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.07924

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

"ChatDev uses a chat chain to divide each phase
into smaller subtasks further, enabling agents’
multi-turn communications to cooperatively propose and develop solutions (e.g., creative ideas
or source code)." 	arXiv:2307.07924 [cs.SE] (or arXiv:2307.07924v5 [cs.SE] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.07924

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? AI Research

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
